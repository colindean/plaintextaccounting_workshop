# Visualizing Reports in Fava {#sec:fava}

[Fava](https://beancount.github.io/fava/) is the best visualization tool for the Plaintext Accounting ecosystem as of this writing.
Fava requires input in a specific variant of Ledger format used by Beancount, a Ledger-like that uses a more explicit syntax.
Fortunately, we can convert Ledger to Beancount and be able to use Fava fully.

## Converting to Beancount {#sec:use_ledger2beancount}

Having installed `ledger2beancount` using the instructions in @sec:install_ledger2beancount, you can run it after making your own configuration file.

Listing: Running `ledger2beancount` {#lst:running_l2b}

```bash
cp ledger2beancount.yml myl2b.yml
# edit myl2b.yml in your text editor!
bin/ledger2beancount --config myl2b.yml 2020.ledger > 2020.beancount
```

## Running Fava

This one's simple!

Listing: Running `fava` {#lst:running_fava}

```bash
fava 2020.beancount
```

Fava will run a webserver accessible via [`http://localhost:5000`](http://localhost:5000). You can explore around the Fava interface, notably two views:

1. Income Statement -> Net Profit. This is a cashflow analysis, Income minus Expenses.
2. Balance Sheet -> Net Worth. This is a net worth analysis, Assets minus Liabilities.

You may see some _errors_ on the left sidebar. `ledger2beancount` can't handle 100% of all things, so sometimes Beancount still works while silently failing.
For example, balance assertions can be ambiguous, so `ledger2beancount` converts in a way that Beancount will continue to work but not enforce the assertions.
It's OK, because any assertions you've made still guard your record in your original transaction log.

## Integrating Beancount & Fava in your `Makefile`

Move your `ledger2beancount` installation into `scripts/ledger2beancount` and
its configuration file into `scripts`, as well.
Then, you can append @lst:makefile_fava to your `Makefile`.
With that, you'll be able to run `make fava` and know that the underlying
beancount-format file will be updated if you've made changes to the `ledger`
file from which it is produced.
That is the magic of `make`!

Listing: Additional `Makefile` tasks (`Makefile.09.fava.txt`) {#lst:makefile_fava}

```{.makefile pipe="tee Makefile.09.fava.txt"}
## beancount compat & fava

L2B = scripts/ledger2beancount
L2B_BIN = $(L2B)/bin/ledger2beancount
L2B_CONFIG = scripts/ledger2beancount.yml

BEANCOUNT_FILE=reports/$(LEDGER_FILE).beancount

beancount: $(BEANCOUNT_FILE)

fava: $(BEANCOUNT_FILE)
	fava $(<)

$(BEANCOUNT_FILE): $(LEDGER_FILE) $(L2B_CONFIG)
	$(L2B_BIN) --config $(L2B_CONFIG) $< > $@

```
