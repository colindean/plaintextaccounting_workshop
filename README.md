# Plain Text Accounting Workshop

:warning: :warning:
If you're wanting to follow the workshop,
download the PDF (or the HTML) and the tar.gz from the
[releases page](https://github.com/colindean/plaintextaccounting_workshop/releases/latest).

If you're reading the this README on the linked repo, you're not reading the right thing:
the instructions below are for _building_ the workshop distributable files.

## Contributing to the Workshop

The Markdown files in this directory are [`pandoc`-flavored
Markdown](https://pandoc.org) so they may not correctly render on GitHub. This
is especially true of the tables.

Run `brew bundle` to install the easily available dependencies to build this
workshop document.

And then there's the no so easily available:

* [`panpipe`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/panpipe "warning: takes forever to compile all dependencies and install") ([git](http://chriswarbo.net/git/panpipe/git/index.html)) ([my custom fork](https://github.com/colindean/panpipe))

Run `make open` to compile the PDF and open it in a PDF viewer.

Run `make watch` to start an edit-compile loop.

The â„– 1 rule? _Leave it better than you found it._
