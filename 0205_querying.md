# Querying Your Transactions

## Querying Accounts {#sec:querying_accounts}

A bare balance or register report is great for seeing all data. However, it's
more realistic to limit output in some way in order to see transactions related to other
transations or accounts related to others in some way. `ledger` has a very
powerful query language, the key tenets of which you'll learn in these next few
sections

Perhaps you want to only see your assets on hand. Run a balance report and
specify `Assets` with `ledger -f ex.ledger balance Assets` to see only Assets.
@Lst:examples_assets shows the output.

Listing: Assets-only report on @lst:examples {#lst:examples_assets}
```{pipe="sh"}
ledger -f ex.ledger balance Assets
```

::: tryit

**TRY IT:** Try some other accounts present in `ex.ledger` to see the balance for top-level accounts
as well as subaccounts.

:::

If you're not sure what accounts are available to be queried, `ledger` can
help.
To see the accounts present in a transaction log,
use the `accounts` commmand in place of `balance` or
`register`. You will see something like @lst:example_accounts.

Listing: `ledger -f ex.ledger accounts` output {#lst:example_accounts}
```{pipe="sh"}
ledger -f ex.ledger accounts
```

## Important Balance Report Types

In the introductory talk you watched as a part of @sec:intro_talk, you learned
about two important report types:
_Cashflow_ (also called _Profit and Loss_) and _Net Worth_.

### Cashflow {#sec:cashflow}

Cashflow tracks Income and Expenses: money that came in from outside of your
control and money that exited your control. Subtract Expenses from Income and
you will know if you had a _gain_ and turned a _profit_ or experienced a _loss_.

`ledger` makes a cashflow report incredible easy. The query is simply `Income
Expenses`! Try it out on `ex.ledger`. See @lst:example_cashflow for the
expected output of `ledger -f ex.ledger bal Income Expenses`.

Listing: A cashflow report generated by `ledger -f ex.ledger bal Income Expenses` {#lst:example_cashflow}

```{pipe="sh"}
ledger -f ex.ledger bal Income Expenses
```

### Net Worth {#sec:networth}

Net Worth tracks Assets and Liabilities: money that you control and money owed to someone else.
Subtract Liabilities from Assets and you will ascertain your current net worth.
It's OK if this number is negative: it just means that you owe more than you currently have.
When tracking your net work for real, don't forget to track real property, like a house or a car.
A house is an asset that has a corresponding liability that goes away over time: a mortgage!
You'll see how to track house value, mortgage, and associated expenses in @sec:commodity_home.

Like the cashflow report, ascertaining net worth is very easy in `ledger`.
The query is simply `Assets Liabilities`.
See @lst:example_networth for the expected output of `ledger -f ex.ledger bal Assets Liabilities`.

Listing: A net worth report generated by `ledger -f ex.ledger bal Assets Liabilities`. {#lst:example_networth}

```{pipe="sh"}
ledger -f ex.ledger bal Assets Liabilities
```

## Querying Payees {#sec:querying_payees}

When you want to find all of the transactions for a certain payee, `ledger` has
a special query keyword for it: `payee`.
Using `payee` is common way to find transactions with a business where you
might have used different methods of payment, like cash on one visit but
a debit or credit card the next. @Lst:payee_query shows this.

Listing: A register of Commonplace Coffee purchases `ledger -f ex.ledger reg payee "Commonplace Coffee"` {#lst:payee_query}

```{pipe="sh"}
ledger -f ex.ledger reg payee "Commonplace Coffee"
```
::: tryit

**TRY IT:** Try finding the other payees through a payee query.

## Querying Tagged Transactions {#sec:querying_tagged_transactions}

Tagged transactions are a powerful way to set simple key-value pairs of
metadata associated with a transaction. For example, you could track the
contact information of payees or maybe a warranty expiration date for something
you purchased.

Listing: A transaction with a tag comment (`tx_tags.ledger`) {#lst:tagged_tx}

```{.ledger pipe="ledger -f - print | tee tx_tags.ledger"}
2020-06-29 Costco
  ; warranty_expiration: 2023-06-29
  Expenses:Electronics:Computer   1,200.00 USD
  Expenses:Groceries                200.00 USD
  Liabilities:CreditCard:Visa

2020-07-01 Costco
  Expenses:Groceries      100.00 USD
  Liabilities:CreditCard:Visa

````

Using the `register` and `print` commands, we can see just the transactions
that have a tag (@lst:warranty_tag) or match based on tag value
(@lst:warranty_tag_value).

Listing: A `register` of transactions that have the `warranty_expiration` tag with
`ledger -f tx_tags.ledger reg tag warranty_expiration` {#lst:warranty_tag}

```{pipe="sh"}
ledger -f tx_tags.ledger reg tag warranty_expiration
```

Listing: A `print` of transactions that have the `warranty_expiration` tag with
`ledger -f tx_tags.ledger print tag warranty_expiration=2023-06-29` {#lst:warranty_tag_value}

```{pipe="sh"}
ledger -f tx_tags.ledger print tag warranty_expiration=2023-06-29
```

## Limiting by Date

For the last set of basic reports, it's important to learn limiting by date:
setting a beginning of the report, an end, and how to group within a specified
time period.
For instance, you might want to know how much you spent on coffee for June
and July 2017.

`--begin` and `--end` take a date-like string, such as `2017/06/30` or `June 2017`,
or a relative date such as `last July`. `--begin` is inclusive and `--end` is
exclusive.
That is, if you specify `2020/07/24` as the end date, transactions dated
`2020/07/23` will be included but not those dated `2020/07/24`.

`ledger` supports a few grouping shortcuts for time periods: `--daily`,
`--weekly`, `--monthly`, `--quarterly`, and `--yearly`.
These are useful for showing the register for these time periods in order
to see changes within that time period.

Listing: A date-limited, monthly query: `ledger -f ex.ledger --begin 'June 2017' --end 'August 2017' --monthly reg 'Coffee$'` {#lst:basic_date_query}

```{pipe="sh"}
ledger -f ex.ledger --begin 'June 2017' --end 'August 2017' --monthly reg 'Coffee$'
```

One more thing: notice the `$` in the query. `ledger` supports regular
expressions (regex) for queries. In fact, it uses it by default.
If you're familiar with regex, you'll understand this expression.
Searching `Coffee` is actually matching accounts `.*Coffee.*` but the inclusion
of another regex marker, such as the `$` which indicates to only look at the
end of a line or `^`, which only matches from the beginning, changes that
default.

::: tryit

**TRY IT:** create a transaction that includes the word "Assets" in a posting's
account, but not at the beginning. Try "Expenses:Assets". Now, try the cashflow
report as described in @sec:cashflow. What happened? What can you do to fix
the report so that it will work with this account name in your records?

:::

::: protip

**PROTIP:** Avoid using the top-level accounts anywhere in a subaccount.
That is, the words `Assets`, `Expenses`, `Income`, `Liabilities`, and `Equity`
should only ever appear at the _beginning_ of account names.
If you don't do this, you will _have to_ use `^` in your queries involving
these top-level accounts. It's not a bad idea to do that anyway!

:::

## Sorting

Nearly all queries can be sorted in some way.
Sorting `print` or `register` with `--sort d` will sort by date.
Sorting `balance` with `--sort T` sorts by the absolute value of the total for
each account.

`ledger`'s `--sort` option actually takes what's called a _VEXPR_, or a value
expression. The [`ledger` docs on value expressions](https://www.ledger-cli.org/3.0/doc/ledger3.html#Value-Expressions) are quite in-depth, but @tbl:common_sorts contains
some of the most common ones.

Table: Common value expression variables used for simple sorting keys {#tbl:common_sorts}

|Variable  |Purpose                                                    |
|:--------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------|
|`d`|A posting’s date, as the number of seconds past the epoch. This is always “today” for an account.
|`a`| The posting’s amount; the balance of an account, without considering children. |
|`v`| The market value of a posting or an account, without its children. |
|`X`| '1' if a posting’s transaction has been cleared, '0' otherwise. |
